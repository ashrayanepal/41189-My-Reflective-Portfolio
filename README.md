# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio
## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I got introduced to the concept of systems which included complex and complicated systems, characteristics of complex and complex adaptive systems, social systems and sociotechnical systems.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
All of the above were new concepts that I had never learned about previously. I now know the definition of a system. I know that systems have boundaries such as open, closed and isolated systems where matter and energy can cross the boundary of open systems, energy can pass through the boundary of closed systems and neither can pass through the boundary of isolated systems. I now know that this means the universe is the only isolated system that exists. Complex systems are unpredictable and made of millions of components whereas a complicated system is predictable but also made up of millions of components. Complex systems show self-organisation and emergence. I learned that there are different levels of complexity depending on the number of elements that make up a system. I learned that complex adaptive systems are complex systems that can adapt in a certain environment through learning and evolving. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained deeper insight into how systems operate in everyday life. Learning that a lot of things around me are systems changed how I perceived the world and made me more aware of how systems are an essential part of life. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength that I observed during this lesson was that I enjoyed the content that was being taught. This greatly benefits my learning and results in me being more engaged during the lesson.
A weakness I observed during this lesson was that I would take quite a while to grasp the concepts that the tutor was talking about. It took me a while to grasp the difference between a complex and complicated system and only fully understood the concept the day after the lesson.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Although I enjoyed the content, I found it difficult to sit through a three-hour lesson. I became tired during the third hour of the lesson finding hard to concentrate
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Over time, I will become used to attending three-hour lessons. However, from next week I will try to maintain my attention throughout the whole lesson and hopefully be able to learn concepts more efficiently
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I came to the lesson prepared to take notes, but I believe the best way to learn in this class is to listen first and write what you learn after. I tried this method of learning for the last part of the tutorial and found that I remembered more of the things that I heard than what I wrote in my notes. 

##Week 2
###What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt the difference between a model and a good model is parsimony, which defines the best model to be the one with the greatest realism along with the least parameter and model complexity. I learnt a couple new concepts such as mental models and the wisdom of crowds. 
###What do I ‘now know’ that I did not know before?
Modelling is not new. People use models every day to comprehend their surroundings, e.g. a map. Another thing I learnt that I did not know before is that through the use of wisdom of crowds, people were able to determine almost the exact location of a missing submarine. I learnt the concept of many model thinking and that involving the use of a handful of models can be used to better understand a particular situation/idea. 
###What insights have I gained?
I have gained further insight as to how models are used in everyday life. Learning about wisdom of crowds made me wonder how connected and in sync human beings are as a species especially with the example about the missing submarine. Even if people were far off the right answer, other people’s bad guesses averaged it out to a specific location where the submarine was found. My understanding of why modelling is important has increased significantly after this week’s lesson.
###What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I enjoy the content being taught so far making it easier for me to learn.
The weakness I found was I found the mathematics used in the tutorial slide hard to understand which may present as a problem further in the semester. 
###What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I / my team) handle them?
I still struggled to stay engaged through a 3-hour lesson the week before but that had improved. I think this can be improved over time as I get used to taking classes. 
###What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next class I plan on being as engaged in class as I was this week and try to have as little concentration lapses as I can.
###What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I tried my theory last week of just listening during class and I found myself a lot more engaged in the class. However, I felt as though I retained more information when writing my notes so I might make notes of key concepts to help me remember them after class.
