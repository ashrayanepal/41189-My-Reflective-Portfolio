# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio
## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I got introduced to the concept of systems which included complex and complicated systems, characteristics of complex and complex adaptive systems, social systems and sociotechnical systems.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
All of the above were new concepts that I had never learned about previously. I now know the definition of a system. I know that systems have boundaries such as open, closed and isolated systems where matter and energy can cross the boundary of open systems, energy can pass through the boundary of closed systems and neither can pass through the boundary of isolated systems. I now know that this means the universe is the only isolated system that exists. Complex systems are unpredictable and made of millions of components whereas a complicated system is predictable but also made up of millions of components. Complex systems show self-organisation and emergence. I learned that there are different levels of complexity depending on the number of elements that make up a system. I learned that complex adaptive systems are complex systems that can adapt in a certain environment through learning and evolving. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained deeper insight into how systems operate in everyday life. Learning that a lot of things around me are systems changed how I perceived the world and made me more aware of how systems are an essential part of life. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength that I observed during this lesson was that I enjoyed the content that was being taught. This greatly benefits my learning and results in me being more engaged during the lesson.
A weakness I observed during this lesson was that I would take quite a while to grasp the concepts that the tutor was talking about. It took me a while to grasp the difference between a complex and complicated system and only fully understood the concept the day after the lesson.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Although I enjoyed the content, I found it difficult to sit through a three-hour lesson. I became tired during the third hour of the lesson finding hard to concentrate
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Over time, I will become used to attending three-hour lessons. However, from next week I will try to maintain my attention throughout the whole lesson and hopefully be able to learn concepts more efficiently
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I came to the lesson prepared to take notes, but I believe the best way to learn in this class is to listen first and write what you learn after. I tried this method of learning for the last part of the tutorial and found that I remembered more of the things that I heard than what I wrote in my notes.
