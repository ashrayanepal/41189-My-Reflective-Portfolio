# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio
## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I got introduced to the concept of systems which included complex and complicated systems, characteristics of complex and complex adaptive systems, social systems and sociotechnical systems.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
All of the above were new concepts that I had never learned about previously. I now know the definition of a system. I know that systems have boundaries such as open, closed and isolated systems where matter and energy can cross the boundary of open systems, energy can pass through the boundary of closed systems and neither can pass through the boundary of isolated systems. I now know that this means the universe is the only isolated system that exists. Complex systems are unpredictable and made of millions of components whereas a complicated system is predictable but also made up of millions of components. Complex systems show self-organisation and emergence. I learned that there are different levels of complexity depending on the number of elements that make up a system. I learned that complex adaptive systems are complex systems that can adapt in a certain environment through learning and evolving. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained deeper insight into how systems operate in everyday life. Learning that a lot of things around me are systems changed how I perceived the world and made me more aware of how systems are an essential part of life. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength that I observed during this lesson was that I enjoyed the content that was being taught. This greatly benefits my learning and results in me being more engaged during the lesson.
A weakness I observed during this lesson was that I would take quite a while to grasp the concepts that the tutor was talking about. It took me a while to grasp the difference between a complex and complicated system and only fully understood the concept the day after the lesson.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Although I enjoyed the content, I found it difficult to sit through a three-hour lesson. I became tired during the third hour of the lesson finding hard to concentrate
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Over time, I will become used to attending three-hour lessons. However, from next week I will try to maintain my attention throughout the whole lesson and hopefully be able to learn concepts more efficiently
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I came to the lesson prepared to take notes, but I believe the best way to learn in this class is to listen first and write what you learn after. I tried this method of learning for the last part of the tutorial and found that I remembered more of the things that I heard than what I wrote in my notes. 

## Week 2
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt the difference between a model and a good model is parsimony, which defines the best model to be the one with the greatest realism along with the least parameter and model complexity. I learnt a couple new concepts such as mental models and the wisdom of crowds. 
### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not know before?
Modelling is not new. People use models every day to comprehend their surroundings, e.g. a map. Another thing I learnt that I did not know before is that through the use of wisdom of crowds, people were able to determine almost the exact location of a missing submarine. I learnt the concept of many model thinking and that involving the use of a handful of models can be used to better understand a particular situation/idea. I also learnt the seven uses for models which were reason, explain, design communicate, act, predict and explore. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained further insight as to how models are used in everyday life. Learning about wisdom of crowds made me wonder how connected and in sync human beings are as a species especially with the example about the missing submarine. Even if people were far off the right answer, other people’s bad guesses averaged it out to a specific location where the submarine was found. My understanding of why modelling is important has increased significantly after this week’s lesson.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I enjoy the content being taught so far making it easier for me to learn.
The weakness I found was I found the mathematics used in the tutorial slide hard to understand which may present as a problem further in the semester. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I / my team) handle them?
I still struggled to stay engaged through a 3-hour lesson the week before but that had improved. I think this can be improved over time as I get used to taking classes. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next class I plan on being as engaged in class as I was this week and try to have as little concentration lapses as I can.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I tried my theory last week of just listening during class and I found myself a lot more engaged in the class. However, I felt as though I retained more information when writing my notes so I might make notes of key concepts to help me remember them after class. 

## Week 3
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt how to model how people behave. This was done by looking at multiple models that can be used including rational models, behavioural models and rule-based models. I also learnt models that show how people decide. In situations of uncertainty, classical, frequency and subjective probability can be used to help make decisions. This can be modelled through the use of decision trees. I learnt how models can show how people conceal/reveal information. This was demonstrated through signaling models such as discrete signaling and continuous signaling. I was shown how people can add value and power through the last on the bus value and the Shapley value. Finally, I learnt how people solve problems in groups through the idea that innovation comes from diversity in group members, helping groups to create new ideas and recombine them in a particular manner. 
### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not know before?
I now know many more models than I previously did. I learnt that all models cannot be applied to the same situation with consistent effectiveness (certain situations require different models). This was learnt through the learning of classical, frequency and subjective probability, and that three different types of probability are required to adapt the situation to the model. 
### What insights have I gained?
On top of last week’s insights of models being used in everyday life, I have now realised that models can be seen in every situation in life. Learning that human interaction, behaviour, and how people work in groups can be modelled has helped me realise this. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I believe my strengths in this subject are learning about models or concepts that apply to people and their minds. I discovered I have a interest in the psychological side of people and I find learning about that interesting 
My weakness I still believe is the mathematical side of the subject.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I / my team) handle them?
I found concentrating throughout a 3-hour lesson hard in the first 2 weeks but this week I found myself focused throughout the lesson. The breaks between the sections have helped me maintain focus throughout.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
For next lesson I need to find a group of 4 for the assignment. I have a friend in the class already and need to gather 2 other people to form a group and hopefully by reaching out to classmates, I can form a group by next lesson.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Listening and taking important side notes has seemed to be the most effective way I have learnt in this subject. I noticed that at the start of the lesson when we recap last week’s work, I am able to remember everything talked about during last lesson. I learnt that this is the most effective way for me to learn during this subject.

## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt three new models in which to model complex adaptive systems. These models are system dynamic models, network models, and agent-based models. A lot of modern problems are driven by feedback, time delays and nonlinearities and system dynamic models are what help represent these features. Modelling networks is done by determining the structure, logic and functionality of the network. Agent-based models are mental models that can help manage and improve complex adaptive systems. Society can be modelled and improved in this manner.  
We also created our group for the group assignment today. My group consists of Aniket, Akash, Redah and myself.
### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not know before?
I now know three different models. I know that these models can be applied to real life scenarios just like all the other models. I realised that models can be learnt to prevent or improve current living situations such as COVID-19. Modelling can help improve the way we try and rid of the virus and how we approach keeping people safe. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained three new lenses in which I can model the world. I have already noticed these models being used in everyday situations. I gained insight into how models can help improve the situation of the current global pandemic of the coronavirus.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
From this week and previous weeks, I found it true that I find learning about models that apply to society the most interesting. This week I found agent-based modelling to be the most interesting one out of the three. Another strength I found was that it was easy for me to find a group through social connections outside of class. 
My weaknesses I still believe is the mathematical understanding required for some concepts. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I / my team) handle them?
After we chose teams this week, we had to select someone to be the leader to communicate with the tutor. Initially none of us wanted to be the leader as no one wanted to have additional pressure put onto them. However, after discussing that the leader will only be the spokesperson for the group and will not have to take on additional work, we chose the person with the best speaking skills to be our leader.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I am now finding it much easier to pay attention throughout the whole lesson. 
Next week our group needs to have discussed and decided on which topic we will be addressing for our assignment. This needs to be done before managing workload throughout the group.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I have continued to listen during class while taking important side notes to help me remember key topics after each lesson. I still believe this is the most effective way for me to learn concepts in this subject. 
Engaging in conversation with my group will help to make sure everyone is invested into the group work as much as I am and that no one slacks off doing work. This is a theory I have about groupwork that I have yet to test. 

## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we were introduced to the concepts of probability distribution, normal distribution and long-tailed distributions. Probability distribution simply put, is the list of all possible outcomes accompanied with their corresponding probability values. These are usually represented in line graphs and they help us understand the aggregate of action in complex systems. Normal distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution which is a bell curve symmetrical in shape. The width and the peak usually will depend on two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation. Long-tailed distributions are hyperbola shaped curves with their shape affected by its power (mathematical). These are used in instances of a large event that has a sufficient enough probability to be concerned of (e.g. COVID-19).  
### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not know before?
One of my other subjects, business statistics, regularly uses probability distributions. I have been able to see how they can be used to model real life situations which has changed the way I see how distribution works.
### What insights have I gained?
I have been provided a new lens to look through the world in through the concept of probability distribution. I have further broadened my knowledge on how mathematics can be applied to real life situations, more specifically with probability distributions. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have not observed any new strengths. 
I have still observed that I am a bit slower at grasping and understanding concepts that involve mathematics in them. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I / my team) handle them?
This week we had to decide which sections that each person would do for the assignment. We decided to overcome this challenge by having a private call in which we discussed which parts we all felt the most comfortable with and split the workload evenly according to everyone’s preferences. 
As mentioned previously, I still have problems with understanding concepts involving mathematics, but I will work towards overcoming this through further individual practice with math problems. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next week, our group needs to have made progress on the group assignment. We have to make it a point to at least get work done earlier rather than later.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Notes during class has still been the most effective way for me to learn.
I still believe that staying in touch with group members will ensure that everyone feels the same amount of responsibility to getting their work done. I will further be doing this in the next couple of weeks before the pre-submission due date.

## Week 6
### What have I learnt this week?
This week, we learnt about Markov models, Random Walk models and the riot, broadcast, diffusion, and contagion models. Markov models are often used for situations where something can transition into something else (e.g. sunny weather to rainy weather, alert students to bored students). The general assumptions for this model are that there is a finite number of states, fixed transition probabilities, eventually goes from one state to another and it is not a simple cycle. Random Walk models are used for situations where a path is to be determined from a number of random steps, which involves finding the probabilities of which direction the next step is being taken. The riot model is a model that measures individuals’ threshold for rioting and can determine which locations riots are most likely to occur. The broadcast model measures the spread of ideas or information through any form of media. A formula is derived which determines that the number of informed people at a given time = number of people informed in previous period + probability a susceptible person hears information x number of susceptible people. The diffusion model is used to determine how a particular innovation is doing in the market. This is done by calculating the spread of purchases through a mathematical formula, similar to the broadcast model formula. The contagion model is designed to measure the spread of diseases and can estimate probabilities of more spreading and recovery. This model can also be applied to books, songs, phrases and exercise regimes.  
### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not know before?
I now know that a majority of the models learnt so far have some sort of mathematical element to it (e.g. a derived formula). I have furthered my knowledge in models and now know that there is literally a model for every single situation. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained new lenses to look at the world through six new models. I found modelling the riots to be a very interesting concept and have never looked at the potential of riots to be due to individual human thresholds. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have perceived no new strengths since last lesson.
I have also perceived no new weaknesses but have been further confused with mathematical concepts. However, I have realised it is more important to understand how the model works rather than the mathematics behind it. I am still working to better understand these concepts mathematically. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I / my team) handle them?
For our assignment this week, in my pair we discussed which models we were going to use for the assignment. We decided to have a meeting and came up with two models: Agent-based model and behavioural model. We still have one more model to decide on, but we have started working on writing our parts for the other two.
As previously mentioned, I had struggled with mathematical concepts and am working on improving my understanding on these.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next week we need to determine our other model we are going to use for our assignment. We also need to continue working on the sections with the other models.
I also need to get better with mathematical concepts.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Short notes during class has been a very good way for me to learn so far. 
Staying in touch with group members is a key component in making sure everyone is engaged in the task at hand and lowers the chance of a group member slacking off. I will continue to do this in the future before the pre-submission.

## Week 7
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt a couple of new models. We learnt about peer effects and social contagion and the models that come under this category are the segregation model, riot model and standing ovation model. The segregation model looks at the fact that there is widespread racial and income segregation in most parts of the world. The model is mainly used with whether someone should stay in a certain area or not based on if they fit the racial or economic situation in their area. The riot model and the standing ovation model are models that have already been looked at in other sections of this subject. We learnt about coordination and culture and how culture can be modelled through a series of coordination games. This is used in the culture model where if people meet/interact with each other, they gain each other’s cultural habits or traits. We also learnt about social learning which looks at similar things to coordination and culture. However, it focuses more on the aspect of leaders’ vs sheep, where a part of the population would lead a certain trend or fashion and the sheep will follow. 
### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not know before?
Although I was aware that models could be used for everything, I was not aware that cultural spread could be modelled until this week. I found it very interesting that the spread of habits such as taking your shoes off before entering the house could be modelled. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained new lenses to look at the world through the knowledge of new models. Particularly, the modelling of cultural spread which I found to be the most interesting.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Again, I noticed that when models were applied to certain real-life situations that were relevant to my current situation, I found them a lot easier to understand and learn about.
I noticed with the mathematics presented on the slides about social learning that I struggled with understanding the math but understanding the concept was completely fine. I still need to improve on the mathematics aspect of things.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I / my team) handle them?
For our assignment, we have completed the writing for our agent-based model and behavioural model sections and we are still looking for our last model. This is not an obstacle we have overcome but we are planning to look through slides from previous classes to try and find the most appropriate model. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
We have our mid semester break next week, giving us plenty of time to find a third model for our assignment. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I am continuing with taking notes during class and it is working well.
I am also keeping in touch with group members to make sure everyone is still motivated to complete the assignment and do well in it.

## Mid-Semester Break

## Week 8
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt two new concepts. These were the Colonel Blotto Game and the Prisoners Dilemma. The Colonel Blotto Game is a strategy-based concept that was founded during war, where two colonels from opposing camps would plot against each other to win as many battle fronts as possible to win the war. They had to strategise based on the number of resources they had and their opponent had. This concept has been brought out in the modern world to fight against issues in politics, sports and even against COVID-19. The Prisoners Dilemma is a concept where two prisoners are offered a deal where they have to either confess or remain silent. If both prisoners remain silent then they both serve out a short sentence. If they both confess, then they both serve out a slightly longer sentence. However, if one prisoner confesses and the other remains silent, then the prisoner that remains silent will serve out a very long sentence, while the prisoner that confesses walks away from jail time. This concept is usually applied in crime and they try to get information out of the criminals. 
### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not know before?
I had previously heard of the Prisoners Dilemma and had always thought it would be best for both parties if they were to choose to confess. If both confess, then they only end up with a slightly longer sentence and if the other person stays silent then the person confessing gets no jail time. Adding up the amount of jail time received for picking each one, it is determined that confess is the safer option to pick. I also now know that early war was planned using the Colonel Blotto Game and found that very interesting. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained two new lenses to model the world with. I also found it interesting to gain insight as to how colonels would strategise during war. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have observed no new strengths or weaknesses
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I / my team) handle them?
After the mid semester break, we still had not come up with a third model. However, after this specific lesson we had decided that the Colonel Blotto Game was the best third model for our assignment as it best fits with the topic of COVID-19 prevention. We came to this conclusion through a quick group call after the meeting to discuss if that was the best option out of the remaining models and decided that it was.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
For this week, we need to submit our assignment. From there we need to provide feedback to another groups assignment and get started on our week 12 submission. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I am continuing taking notes while listening in class.
I have also remained in constant communication with my group to keep everyone engaged in our assignment and it seems to be working as everyone is doing their parts.

## Questions are different from here due to rest of the weeks being dedicated to assignment work only.
